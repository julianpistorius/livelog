livelog
=======

Inspired by Tim Berglunds ["git-livelog" script](https://gist.github.com/tlberglund/3714970) - Added fetch and some user input

Dump the script somewhere (/usr/local/bin/ is a good place so you can use it globally), and then run it on a 3rd monitor or something to keep an eye on your colleagues' activity. My expected use will be to keep it up somewhere and if it is changing frequently, it will catch my attention and I should probably pull/merge.
